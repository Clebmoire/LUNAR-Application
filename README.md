# LUNAR-Application
**LUNAR** (Location-based Unified Navigation using Augmented Reality) is a cross-platform mobile application built with **.NET MAUI** and **Unity** for guiding users through physical environments using **Augmented Reality pathfinding**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Scan QR codes to determine the starting location.
- Select a destination from a dynamically populated list.
- Launch an embedded **Unity AR scene** for visual navigation.
- Uses **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** to compute the shortest path.
- Displays directional path markers or moves XR Rig in editor for testing.
- Cross-platform support via .NET MAUI (Android, iOS, Windows, MacCatalyst).
- Unity AR integration targeted for Android.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

### .NET MAUI App (UniApp)

- **QR Scanner** using ZXing.Net.MAUI
- **Destination Selector** UI in XAML
- **Unity Integration** triggered post-selection
- **Platform Services** interface (`IUnityLauncher`) used to communicate with Unity
- Platform-specific implementation in `MainActivity.cs` for Android

### Unity AR Scene

- Built with **Unity 2022.3.48f1**
- Contains:
  - Waypoints (named nodes) in the scene
  - `PathfindingManager.cs` using **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm**
  - AR path markers (e.g., pins, dots) instantiated along the path
  - Two operating modes:
    - **Option A**: Editor mode â€” XR Rig moves to `"START"` point
    - **Option B**: Device mode â€” AR pins appear overlaid on real-world view
